## Unity 3rd Person RPG

RPG game that takes place in a ghost village.

* Player can switch between two weapons, both inflict different damage and fire at different rates.
* There is an inventory system where items can be stored in quantities. Consumable items are deducted and heal the player's luck/sanity. Any item can be deleted as long as it's not a weapon.
* Consumable items(flowers and darumas) can be picked up and stored.
* A quest and dialogue system are added on the ghost NPC. If the player passes the Luck Points check, the quest is added as the current quest.
* Both the training dummies and the enemy can take damage and have health bars. Upon killing the enemy and completing the quest, the player is awarded Spirit Points, and the NPC ghost disappears.
